-- Puzzle 1: Finding Distinct Values .
-- Question: Explain at least two ways to find distinct values based on two columns.
SELECT DISTINCT
    CASE WHEN col1 < col2 THEN col1 ELSE col2 END AS col1,
    CASE WHEN col1 < col2 THEN col2 ELSE col1 END AS col2
FROM InputTbl;
-- Option 2
SELECT DISTINCT
    IIF(col1 < col2, col1, col2) as col1,
	IIF(col1 < col2, col2, col1) as col2
FROM InputTbl;

-- Puzzle 2: Removing Rows with All Zeroes
-- Question: If all the columns have zero values, then donâ€™t show that row. In this case, we have to remove the 5th row while selecting data.
SELECT *
FROM TestMultipleZero
WHERE A <> 0
  OR B <> 0
  OR C <> 0
  OR D <> 0;

-- Puzzle 3: Find those with odd ids
SELECT name
FROM section1
WHERE id % 2 = 1;

-- Puzzle 4: Person with the smallest id (use the table in puzzle 3)
SELECT TOP 1 name
FROM section1
ORDER BY id ASC;

-- Puzzle 5: Person with the highest id (use the table in puzzle 3)
SELECT TOP 1 name
FROM section1
ORDER BY id DESC;

-- Puzzle 6: People whose name starts with b (use the table in puzzle 3)
SELECT name
FROM section1
WHERE name like 'b%';

-- Puzle 7: Write a query to return only the rows where the code contains the literal underscore _ (not as a wildcard).
SELECT *
FROM ProductCodes
WHERE Code like '%[_]%';
